Disassimpl is a simple, multi-architecture (or at least it is uspposed to be), multi-mode disassembly utility powered by the Capstone Disassembly Engine found <a href="http://www.capstone-engine.org/">here.</a> It uses the Python's Capstone module and said module is accessed from the Python C API. This adds a few more dependencies, but avoids some of the annoying issues with the Capstone C API. If you;re installing a disassembler, you probably won't mind installing a couple Python3 modules anyway, so.
