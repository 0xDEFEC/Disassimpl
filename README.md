Disassimpl is a simple, multi-architecture (or at least it is uspposed to be), multi-mode disassembly utility powered by the Capstone Disassembly Engine found <a href="http://www.capstone-engine.org/">here.</a> It uses the Python's Capstone module and said module is accessed from the Python C API. This adds a few more dependencies, but avoids some of the annoying issues with the Capstone C API. If you're installing a disassembler, you probably won't mind installing a couple Python3 modules anyway, so. 
<br/><br/>
Please note, a large portion of this utility has not been tested, and some architectures may not even disassemble correctly. Considering this entire project is ~500 lines, I am even more confident it will break on some challenges. Furthermore, this isn't even a stable <i>release.</i> I still have concepts in mind that shall be added, so I wouldn't even call this version 1.0; it will likely stay this way for a bit. The only well-tested portion of Disassimpl's functionality is the extraction of the file structure from binaries, but the disassembly function is largely untested (and visibly misbehaves on PPC and MIPS-esc architectures).
